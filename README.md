# St Louis Alternative Open Data Portal
## About
Since the St Louis Open Data Portal only offers data in Shapefile form, this repo is dedicated to hosting that data in GeoJson since this is what web developers are used to using when building applications.

As of this point this data is just static content for boundaries of Neighborhoods and Wards, but in the future it might be used for hosting web friendly data that is formated on a scheduled basis. 

## Wards
The wards data comes directly from the St Louis Open Data Portal
